## Introduction

CloudCruise is a unified CI/CD pipeline solution aimed at simplifying the development and deployment workflows for your applications. It integrates seamlessly with popular tools like Jenkins, SonarQube, OWASP Dependency Check, and GitHub, leveraging the power of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for robust infrastructure and scalability.

## Architecture Overview

![CloudCruise Architecture](images/architecture.png)

CloudCruise architecture is built on GCP's Compute Engine service, providing scalable compute resources for your CI/CD needs. Jenkins serves as the central orchestration hub, managing the build, test, and deployment processes. SonarQube ensures code quality and security with advanced static code analysis, while OWASP Dependency Check identifies and mitigates security vulnerabilities in your dependencies.

GitHub webhooks trigger CI/CD pipelines upon code commits, initiating automated builds and deployments. Docker containers are utilized for application packaging and deployment, ensuring consistency across environments. HTML/CSS/JS are employed for the company website, seamlessly integrated into the CI/CD workflow.

## Features

- **End-to-End Automation:** Automate the entire CI/CD pipeline from code commit to deployment, reducing manual intervention and human error.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Leverage GCP Compute Engine for scalable and reliable compute resources, accommodating varying workloads.
- **Code Quality Assurance:** Utilize SonarQube for advanced static code analysis, ensuring code quality and adherence to best practices.
- **Security Monitoring:** OWASP Dependency Check identifies and mitigates security vulnerabilities in project dependencies, enhancing overall application security.
- **GitHub Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with GitHub repositories using webhooks, triggering automated builds and deployments upon code changes.
- **Dockerization:** Package applications into Docker containers for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Email Notifications:** Receive email notifications for build and deployment statuses, keeping stakeholders informed throughout the process.
- **Web UI Testing:** Incorporate automated testing of the company website to ensure functionality and compatibility across browsers.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up CloudCruise, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Access to a Google Cloud Platform account with permissions to create Compute Engine instances.
- Jenkins installed and configured on a virtual machine within your GCP environment.
- SonarQube server deployed for code analysis.
- OWASP Dependency Check integrated into your CI/CD pipeline.
- Docker installed on your Jenkins server for containerization.
- A GitHub repository hosting your application code.
- Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS/JS for website development.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up CloudCruise:

1. Provision a virtual machine on GCP Compute Engine to host Jenkins.
2. Install and configure Jenkins with necessary plugins for CI/CD.
3. Set up SonarQube server for code analysis.
4. Integrate OWASP Dependency Check into your Jenkins pipeline.
5. Configure GitHub webhooks to trigger Jenkins builds upon code commits.
6. Containerize your application using Docker.
7. Implement email notification functionality in Jenkins for build and deployment statuses.
8. Develop and integrate automated tests for the company website.

For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [Setup Guide](setup.md).

## Usage

Once CloudCruise is set up, the CI/CD pipeline will automatically trigger upon code commits to your GitHub repository. Developers can push changes to the repository, and CloudCruise will handle the rest, including building, testing, and deploying the application.

For day-to-day usage instructions, refer to the [User Guide](user-guide.md).

## Monitoring and Security

CloudCruise ensures robust monitoring and security throughout the CI/CD pipeline:

- **Monitoring:** Utilize Jenkins dashboard to monitor build and deployment statuses in real-time.
- **Security:** Regularly scan project dependencies using OWASP Dependency Check and address any identified vulnerabilities promptly.
